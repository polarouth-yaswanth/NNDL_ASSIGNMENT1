 1Q)	What patterns do you observe in the training and validation accuracy curves?
 Smooth and Steady Increase (Ideal Training)

ðŸ“ˆ Pattern:

Both training and validation accuracy increase steadily.
The validation accuracy closely follows the training accuracy.
The loss consistently decreases.
âœ… Interpretation:

The model is learning properly and generalizing well to unseen data.
Scenario 2: Overfitting

âš  Pattern:

Training accuracy keeps increasing, reaching near 100%.
Validation accuracy plateaus or even decreases after a few epochs.
Validation loss starts increasing while training loss keeps decreasing.

2Q)	How can you use TensorBoard to detect overfitting?
TensorBoard provides multiple ways to detect overfitting:

Ans:
1. Compare Training vs. Validation Accuracy

If training accuracy is high (e.g., 99%) but validation accuracy is low (e.g., 70%), the model is overfitting.
2. Monitor Loss Graphs

If training loss decreases but validation loss increases, overfitting is happening.



3Q)	What happens when you increase the number of epochs?
Ans:Model Continues to Improve (Good Training)

âœ… If the dataset is complex and the model is not overfitting, more epochs will:

Increase accuracy steadily.
Decrease loss continuously.

Overfitting Occurs (Too Many Epochs)

ðŸš¨ If the model is too complex, more epochs will:

Increase training accuracy (close to 100%).
Validation accuracy stagnates or decreases.
Validation loss starts rising.
